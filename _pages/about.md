Welcome!

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Georgia State University. 

I study the impact of foreign rebel support on interstate relations. Specifically, I examine how states respond to foreign rebel support, and whether it creates armed conflict between the adversaries. In a secondary agenda, I study the authoritarian regime practices such as how conflict affects changes in term limits. 

Currently, I am a Graduate Assistant at Democracy Program of The Carter Center. 

I hold an MA in European Studies from Sabanci University and a BA in International Relations from Bilkent University.
